2021, my first year of advent of code!

I'm a bit late to initialising this repo, lol.

Written in, and has taught me a lot of new things know about, python.

Using:
* Data fetching module aocd from: https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data
* utils.py, although I've barely used it, from: utils.py from: https://gist.github.com/mcpower/87427528b9ba5cac6f0c679370789661
